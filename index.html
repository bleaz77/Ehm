        <h1 id="message">Dear Natalie,</h1>
        <p>words cant express... I’m always thinking of you. I’m sorry for all my faults and the ways I may have hurt you. I know I’ve changed, but that’s only because my love for you has grown deeper than you realize.

            I feel jealous because you’re always on my mind and I even dream about you. I’m sorry if my actions ever made you feel like I only loved you for your body....that couldn’t be further from the truth. My feelings for you go far beyond physical attraction.
            
            You are my life, my last love, my last hope. You are more than a body, you are a beautiful soul and my everything. I felt safe and free with you, which sometimes led me to cross boundaries, but please know that it was never my intention to hurt you.
            
            Take all the time you need, baby. I love you for who you are, completely and unconditionally</p>
